# Redis Browser

This repository is a simple docker container wrapper around
[redis browser gem](https://github.com/monterail/redis-browser). It's currently
WIP, but at the end you should get auto-connecting Redis Browser by simple
`docker run etki/redis-browser``.
Feel free to play with it until it's working.
